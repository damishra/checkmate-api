# CheckmateApi

This is the source code for the API behind Checkmate, the chess
website I created for my final submission for Secure Web App Development.

This backend is written in `C#` using `.NET Core 5.0`, `ASP.NET Core`,
`Entity Framework Core`, and `MongoDB`. The main data pipeline uses a 
RESTful interface, while the game moves and chat messages are communicated 
via a WebSocket interface.
